# LibvlcSharp Media Element For Winforms
<p>
Libvlcsharp is wrapper around libvlc(VLC libray). <br>
It is use to play media.  <br>
But we would have to add video control ourself for most platforms.  <br>
By using MediaPlayerelemnt, you will NOT have to do this headche.  <br>
This MediaPlayerElement is only for winforms. <br>
<b>Note : </b> Well it works fine But even I may have done many mistakes. So pardon me.
